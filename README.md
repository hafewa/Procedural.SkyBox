 - Star Sky cubemap can be rotated over time.
 - Directional and moon light will smoothly appear overtime.
 - Fog density under lighting settings can effect the horizon color. You can increase the effect within the shader or decrease 'FogToDay' slider in editor.  
 - 'Use Own Shader' set to true means you'll only be using the directional light and moon light. This shader and material provided won't be part of the logic if you yourself have other solutions.
